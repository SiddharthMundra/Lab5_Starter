# Pt 3. Unit Testing with Jest

1. No. This is because I don't think that this feature could be tested with unit tests. Testing this feature requires validating multiple components working together, such as the UI, server, and the delivery of the message. This could, however, be tested during the development using end-to-end testing; one could send messages to the other on the app and check if it works.

2. Yes. This feature can be effectively tested using unit tests as the validation of a message could be checked by a function if the input exceeds 80 characters. Unit tests would be more efficient for tasks that can have isolated logic.
